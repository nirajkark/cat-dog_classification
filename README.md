## Introduction

This project implements a deep learning model using the MobileNet architecture to classify images as either cats or dogs. The model is trained on a dataset from Kaggle and achieves accurate classification results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from Kaggle: [Cat vs Dog Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). Download the dataset and place it in the `dataset` directory before running the code.

## Installation

To run the Cat vs Dog Classification project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nirajkark/cat-dog_classification.git
   cd cat-dog_classification
